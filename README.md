# Quench

Something made specifically to quench my extreme desire to code.

I have several goals with this project:

* Learn more about the HaxeFlixel API and use as much of it as possible whenever possible rather than creating my own code what serves the same purpose.
* Create something original for once instead of making yet another fork of something else.
* Have fun. It's cheesy, but it's also ultimately the main reason why I started making this project.
* Find bugs in the libraries what I am using so I can report them to the developers.
