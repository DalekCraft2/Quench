# Quench

Something made specifically to quench my extreme desire to code.

<summary>Semi-Relevant Rant</summary>
I made this after I lost progress on Mock Engine with the intention of coding this until Mock Engine's WIP stuff was recovered, but I do not really want to work on Mock Engine anymore because FNF's community makes me cringe.
Fortunately, coding for something other than FNF opens up many opportunities for using the many other features of HaxeFlixel, like its collision system, which is very prominent in this project.
It also lets me create all of the code from scratch instead of using FNF's badly formatted spaghetti code.
