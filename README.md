# Quench

Something made specifically to quench my extreme desire to code. I am losing my mind here, being unable to make progress on Mock Engine whilst it is still in my corrupted old SSD. I may as well make something what can utilize the many other features of HaxeFlixel whilst I wait for an opportunity to find someone who can recover the data.
